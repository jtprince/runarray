= {Runarray}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/mspire]

Runarray - Attempting to provide a fast, pure ruby implementation of NArray
functionality.  Pronounced like Scooby-Doo saying 'Run away!'.

Very much pre-alpha right now although some good functionality has been
implemented.

== Example

    require 'runarray'  
    include Runarray

    na = NArray.float(4) # ->  [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]

== Installation

    gem install runarray
